## How to run the project?

Execute with <code>npm run start</code>

### How long did it take you to finish it?

It took me like 7 hours, though should have spent less time without
distraction from office work.

### What would you have done if time permitted?

I would have added validations via react valdation libraries and implemented proper testing.
